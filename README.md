> for now there are data for only 3 cities.

## live version:

- check this website: https://london-mini-guide-challenge.netlify.app/

## data source

- the data is provided to you in a folder `./data` which contains 3 files: `Harrow.json`, `Heathrow.json` and `stratford.json`.
- each file in this format:

  ```js
  {
      "pharmacies" : [
          {
              "name" :
              "address":
              "website":
              "phone" :
          }
      ],

      "colleges" : [
          {
              "name" :
              "address":
              "website":
              "phone" :
          }
      ],

      "doctors" : [
          {
              "name" :
              "address":
              "website":
              "phone" :
          }
      ],

      "hospitals" : [
          {
              "name" :
              "address":
              "website":
              "phone" :
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
